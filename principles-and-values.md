# Principle 1

_"Pay close attention, friend, to what your father tells you; never forget what you learned at your mother’s knee. Wear their counsel like a winning crown, like rings on your fingers"_

_**Proverbs 1:8-9 (MSG)**_

# Principle 2

_"So, join the company of good men and women,_
    _keep your feet on the tried-and-true paths._
_It’s the men who walk straight who will settle this land,_
    _the women with integrity who will last here._
_The corrupt will lose their lives;_
    _the dishonest will be gone for good."_
